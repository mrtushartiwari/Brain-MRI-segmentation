### Dataset
Source of dataset is kaggle.

[Brain MRI segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)



#### How to use the trained model:
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
    1. cv2
    2. streamlit
    3. PIL
    4. tensorflow
2. Link to trained final model : [EfficientNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10o-7xrqrRWyfmSQaszlO8BPCbryB2VVl?usp=sharing)
3. Download this repo and the trained model folder.
4. change your directory to the file containing application.py and then run the command in terminal. 

`streamlit run application.py`
